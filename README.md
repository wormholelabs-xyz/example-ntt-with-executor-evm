# Example NTT With Executor EVM

This repo contains an EVM helper contract for bundling an [NTT](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers) transfer with an [Executor](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-messaging-executor) request for execution in a single transaction.

For the SVM (Solana) contract, see https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-ntt-with-executor-svm

Mistakes happen, and no matter how hard you try and whether you pay someone to audit it, it may eat your tokens, set
your printer on fire or startle your cat. Cryptocurrencies are a high-risk investment, no matter how fancy.
